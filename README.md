# AtliQ Mart Supply Chain Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the supply chain performance of AtliQ Mart, a growing FMCG manufacturer in Gujarat, India. The aim is to track the service-level performance of product deliveries, specifically focusing on the percentage of orders delivered on time (OT%), delivered in full (IF%), and both on time and in full (OTIF%).

## Problem Statement

AtliQ Mart has been facing challenges with delivering key products on time and in full to its customers. As part of the analysis, I tracked and analyzed the delivery performance to understand where improvements are needed. The objective was to monitor daily service levels, identify gaps, and generate actionable insights to improve the delivery process.

## Objective

The main objectives of this project are:

- To measure and analyze delivery performance using metrics like OT%, IF%, and OTIF%.
- To identify service gaps and delays, and understand their root causes.
- To improve decision-making by providing insights into the performance of daily customer orders.

## Key Features of the Dashboard

1. **Metrics Tracked**: 
   - **On-Time Delivery (OT%)**: The percentage of orders delivered by the agreed date.
   - **In-Full Delivery (IF%)**: The percentage of orders delivered with the complete quantities.
   - **On-Time In-Full (OTIF%)**: A combined metric of orders delivered both on time and in full.

2. **Visual Insights**: 
   - The dashboard shows:
     - **Average Delivery Delay**: On average, orders are delayed by 1.69 days.
     - **Total Late Deliveries**: 13,000 orders have been delivered late from the agreed delivery date.
   - A detailed breakdown of delays by number of days (e.g., one-day, two-day, three-day delays).

3. **Performance Tracking**:
   - **OTIF% Trend**: A trend chart showing the overall performance over time.
   - **Dynamic Metrics**: Switch between key metrics like OT%, IF%, and OTIF% with a single click, along with other indicators like LIFR% and VORF%.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **Power BI**: For building the dashboard and creating the visualizations.
- **Excel**: For cleaning and structuring the raw data.
- **Data Modeling**: Used to design fact and dimension tables for better performance and analysis.

## Approach

1. **Data Collection**: 
   - Collected order and delivery data, including agreed and actual delivery dates, order quantities, and service-level targets.

2. **Data Preparation**: 
   - Cleaned and structured the data in Excel, created fact and dimension tables to organize the data for analysis.

3. **Dashboard Development**: 
   - Created a Power BI dashboard to visualize the delivery metrics, identify trends, and highlight service issues.

4. **Analysis & Insights**: 
   - Through the analysis, I identified key trends such as the average delivery delay of 1.69 days and 13,000 late orders, which were critical in understanding performance issues.

## Challenges

- **Data Accuracy**: Ensuring the data was accurate and structured properly before proceeding with analysis.
- **Dynamic Visuals**: Designing the dashboard to allow for easy switching between metrics (OT%, IF%, OTIF%).
- **Insight Generation**: Transforming raw data into useful insights and trends to help drive improvements in the supply chain.

## Conclusion

This project has provided valuable insights into AtliQ Mart's supply chain performance, particularly regarding delays in delivery and incomplete orders. These insights can be used to improve delivery performance, address service gaps, and ensure better customer satisfaction as AtliQ Mart plans to expand into new cities.
